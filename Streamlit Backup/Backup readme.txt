README for accessing the backup file

The Streamlit Webapp structure
1- MainAPP (Run this file as 'streamlit run MainAPP.py' on the vscode terminal)
2- Homepage (contains text data for the home page of MainAPP)
3- AQI_prediction (Has functions defined which are called in the MainAPP.py file)
4- About section is already written in MainAPP.py
5- WQI section is empty!! require jupyter notebook and ML model for the same !!

CSS UPDATES on the files are appreciated. DO NOT directly add the style , clone the .py file FIRST.

KEEP ALL 3 FILES IN THE SAME FOLDER !!

If streamlit is not able to run on VSCode showing path issues 
use this command on terminal

python -m streamlit run MainAPP.py

this will definitely work 
Thanks,
